2024 Varsity College Year 3 Semester 2 OPSC_7312 POE

**Countify** is a simple Android counter app built using Kotlin. Users can register via email or Google SSO and create custom counters with titles, descriptions, and increment values. All data is saved to Firestore, including user preferences for notifications, theme (dark/light), and language (English/Afrikaans), which persist across sessions. The app also features a settings page where users can manage account details and view a random piece of advice fetched from the Random Advice API.
